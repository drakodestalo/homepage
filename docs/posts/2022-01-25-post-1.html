      <h2>The very beggining</h2>
      <h1>The big-bang of this place</h1>
<p>It's amazing that you ever found this place when it's still on its building phase, as you might have noticed, this is just another blog from any random user, and yes, I'm writing this as an initial test, for sure I'll be writing more dummy entries like this one but I think I'll leave this just as an evidence of the humble begginings of this site (and hopefully it won't stay with this post only).</p>
<p>As you may be aware now, my English is far from perfect, and that's the reason why I decided to write all this stuff in English instead of my mother's language, at first I thought there are a lack of internet content in spanish, but in another hand, I also feel that very few people will take a look over it, nevertheless, if you find something useful I could consider to translate it to spanish.</p>
<p>How to contact me? well... I haven't decided yet how anybody should contact me, if this is the only entry you can see then that shouldn't really matter (I mean, it's the only post right? it doesn't have any handy info), but If I progressed on this project then for sure I left any contact method somewhere.</p>
<p>Enough testing! thank you for reading, you're the best!</p>
